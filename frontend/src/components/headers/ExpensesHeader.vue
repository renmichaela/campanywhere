    <p>Expenses are divided into two categories: "Camping" and "Electric". Camping expenses such as camping spot permits and golf cart rentals are divided according to number of days attending.</p>
    <p>While everyone benefits from having electricity in our camp, obviously those staying in campers end up using more than those in tents. As such, electric expenses are weighted according to each attendee's type of camping in addition to the number of days a person is staying. </p>
